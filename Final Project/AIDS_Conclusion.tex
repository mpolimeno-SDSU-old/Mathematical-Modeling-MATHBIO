In this paper we have covered only a few aspects that have to be considered when modeling HIV-AIDS epidemic and we focused our analysis on the transmission dynamics of the virus within a certain population.\\
We have briefly explored the evolution of epidemic models and seen how they have changed over time, being able to adapt to the newest and up-to-date scientific knowledge. HIV is still very much an epidemic today as it was in the 1980's, with as many as 36 million people living with AIDS worldwide. Fortunately, in the last 30 years significant progress has been made in the treatment of HIV, even though an effective cure is yet to be found.\\
Implementing good models able to accurately predict the dynamics of HIV is critically important for the development of new and more effective treatments, as well as instituting comprehensive programs to narrow the risks of a spread of the disease.\\
As HAART medication still remains often not accessible to many people around the world, it is perhaps necessary to use different strategies to contain the risks of HIV transmission, such as awareness campaigns to educate men, women and young people about the dangers connected to the disease and how to protect themselves from it.\\
